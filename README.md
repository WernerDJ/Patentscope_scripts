The PatentscopeApp_Inv.py is the Applicants Inventors network code. It traces the movements of Inventors between different applicants, showing in a circular network diagram the technology transfer that happens between companies and/or universities when their inventors move from one workplace to the next. Applicants_Inventors_Network.png is the output from the result list used in this example.
